# Jackpot System

This document consolidates information about the jackpot system.

## Overview

The jackpot system provides incentives for participation in the network through randomized rewards.

## Mechanism

The jackpot system uses verifiable randomness to distribute rewards to participants based on their activity and stake in the network.

## Key Components

- Randomness source (Chainlink VRF or Drand)
- Reward pool
- Distribution algorithm
- Claim process

## Security Considerations

The jackpot system is designed with several security measures:
- Tamper-proof randomness
- Transparent distribution
- Audited smart contracts

## Integration with Other Systems

The jackpot system integrates with:
- Token system
- Randomness providers
- Cross-chain functionality

For more details on implementation, see the [smart contracts documentation](/reference/contracts/jackpot).
