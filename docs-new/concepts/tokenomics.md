# Tokenomics

The OmniDragon token economy is designed for long-term sustainability, fair distribution, and value accrual through multiple mechanisms.

## Token Overview

The DRAGON token is the native token of the OmniDragon ecosystem:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Token Name | DRAGON |
| Token Symbol | DRAGON |
| Decimals | 18 |
| Total Supply | 6,942,000 DRAGON |
| Token Type | ERC-20 (Cross-Chain) |
| Supply Model | Fixed Supply |

## Token Distribution

Details about the token distribution will be provided at a later date.

## Fee Structure

One of the unique aspects of the DRAGON token is its built-in fee structure that automatically distributes value across the ecosystem:

    style C fill:#059669,stroke:#047857,color:#fff
```

### 2. Jackpot Incentive

The jackpot system incentivizes holding and trading DRAGON:

-**Holding**: Increases chances of winning jackpots
-**Trading**: Generates more fees for the jackpot pool
-**Staking**: Provides additional jackpot entries

### 3. Governance Rights

DRAGON token holders can participate in governance through the ve69LP mechanism:

-**LP Provision**: Users provide liquidity with DRAGON
-**LP Locking**: LP tokens are locked to receive ve69LP
-**Governance**: ve69LP grants voting power proportional to amount and lock time

## Token Utility

The DRAGON token has multiple utilities within the ecosystem:

1.**Medium of Exchange**: Used for transactions within the ecosystem
2.**Governance**: Liquidity provision + locking for governance rights
3.**Fee Sharing**: ve69LP holders receive a share of transaction fees
4.**Jackpot Participation**: Token holders are eligible for jackpot winnings
5.**Cross-Chain Bridging**: Enables transfer of value across supported chains

## Economic Flywheel

The OmniDragon tokenomics create a self-reinforcing economic flywheel:

```mermaid

    "Governance" : 24.1
    "Token Burn" : 6.9

## Long-Term Sustainability

The OmniDragon tokenomics model is designed for long-term sustainability through:

1.**Fixed Supply**: No inflation, with deflationary pressure from burns
2.**Fee Distribution**: Revenue sharing with token holders
3.**Governance Incentives**: Long-term alignment through time-weighted voting
4.**Cross-Chain Strategy**: Expansion to multiple chains for wider adoption
5.**Partner Ecosystem**: Integration with partner protocols for expanded utility

## Emission Schedule

Details about the token emission schedule will be provided at a later date.

## Cross-Chain Economics

The cross-chain dimension adds unique economic considerations:

1.**Unified Supply**: Total token supply remains constant across all chains (6,942,000 DRAGON)
2.**Chain-Specific Liquidity**: Each chain maintains its own liquidity pools
3.**Chain-Specific Fees**: LayerZero gas fees apply to cross-chain transfers
4.**Bridge Mechanism**: Tokens are burned on source chain and minted on destination chain
5.**Multi-Chain Governance**: Governance decisions apply across all chains

## Market Stabilization Mechanisms

To maintain price stability, several mechanisms are in place:

1.**Liquidity Bootstrapping**: Initial liquidity provision with long-term locks
2.**Dynamic Fee Adjustment**: Governance can adjust fees based on market conditions
3.**Buyback and Burn**: Treasury may conduct periodic buybacks and burns
4.**Jackpot Frequency Control**: Adjusting jackpot triggers to optimize market impact
5.**Staking Incentives**: Encouraging long-term holding through staking rewards
