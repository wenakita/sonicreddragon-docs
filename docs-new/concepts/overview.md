# OmniDragon Protocol Overview

Welcome to the OmniDragon protocol documentation. This overview provides a high-level introduction to the protocol, its key components, and how they work together to create a powerful cross-chain ecosystem.

## What is OmniDragon?

OmniDragon is a multi-chain token protocol that combines several innovative features:

    style B fill:#f59e0b,stroke:#d97706,color:#fff
    style C fill:#059669,stroke:#047857,color:#fff
```

## Token Mechanics

The OmniDragon token (DRAGON) implements a fee mechanism that creates sustainable value:

| Transaction Type | Total Fee | Jackpot | Governance | Burn |
|------------------|-----------|---------|------------|------|
| Buy              | 10%       | 6.9%    | 2.41%      | 0.69% |
| Sell             | 10%       | 6.9%    | 2.41%      | 0.69% |
| Transfer         | 0.69%     | 0%      | 0%         | 0.69% |

These fees fund the jackpot system, governance rewards, and token burns, creating a sustainable ecosystem.

## Jackpot System

The jackpot system provides an automatic jackpot for token holders:

    style C fill:#059669,stroke:#047857,color:#fff
```mermaid

    style B fill:#f59e0b,stroke:#d97706,color:#fff
    style C fill:#059669,stroke:#047857,color:#fff

    style B fill:#f59e0b,stroke:#d97706,color:#fff
    style C fill:#059669,stroke:#047857,color:#fff

The system combines multiple randomness sources to ensure security and reliability, with a verification layer to validate all inputs.
