# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is this project?

This project is a decentralized platform that leverages cross-chain technology, verifiable randomness, and innovative tokenomics to create a secure and scalable ecosystem.

### How does it work?

The system uses a combination of smart contracts across multiple blockchains, connected through secure cross-chain messaging protocols, with randomness provided by Chainlink VRF and Drand.

## Technical Questions

### How is randomness generated?

Randomness is generated using either Chainlink VRF or Drand, depending on the specific use case and chain requirements. Both provide cryptographically verifiable random numbers that cannot be manipulated.

### How do cross-chain operations work?

Cross-chain operations are facilitated through messaging protocols like LayerZero, which ensure secure and reliable communication between different blockchain networks.

## Development Questions

### How do I set up a development environment?

Please refer to the [Developer Setup Guide](/guides/getting-started/developer-setup) for detailed instructions.

### Where can I find API documentation?

API documentation is available in the [Reference section](/reference/api/rest-api).

## Security Questions

### Has the code been audited?

Yes, the core contracts have undergone security audits. You can find the audit reports in the [Security section](/reference/security/audit-documentation-summary).

### How are funds secured?

Funds are secured through a combination of multi-signature wallets, timelock contracts, and regular security audits.
