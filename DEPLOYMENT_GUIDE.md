# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Checklist

### 1. GitHub Actions Status
- Go to: https://github.com/wenakita/sonicreddragon-docs/actions
- You should see a workflow running or recently completed
- Click on it to see the details

### 2. GitHub Pages Settings
- Go to: https://github.com/wenakita/sonicreddragon-docs/settings/pages
- Ensure these settings:
  - **Source**: Deploy from a branch
  - **Branch**: `gh-pages` (root folder)
  - **Custom domain**: `docs.sonicreddragon.io` (if you're using one)

### 3. Workflow Process
Our simplified workflow does the following:
1. ✅ Checks out the code
2. ✅ Sets up Node.js
3. ✅ Installs dependencies
4. ✅ Adds sidebar CSS fixes to custom.css
5. ✅ Creates sidebar JavaScript file
6. ✅ Cleans up unused files
7. ✅ Builds the website
8. ✅ Deploys to gh-pages branch

### 4. What We Fixed
- **Sidebar overlap issue**: Added CSS to properly position the sidebar
- **Mobile sidebar**: Added JavaScript for mobile toggle functionality
- **Build errors**: Removed complex config editing that was causing YAML/TypeScript errors

### 5. Your Site URL
Once deployed successfully, your site will be available at:
- With custom domain: https://docs.sonicreddragon.io
- Without custom domain: https://wenakita.github.io/sonicreddragon-docs

### 6. Troubleshooting
If the deployment fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Ensure the `gh-pages` branch exists
3. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in settings

### 7. Cache Issues
If changes don't appear immediately:
- Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub Pages to update
- Clear your browser cache
- Try accessing in incognito/private mode
- Check with: https://docs.sonicreddragon.io/?v=timestamp

### 8. Next Steps
Once deployed:
1. Test the sidebar on desktop (should be fixed at 250px width)
2. Test on mobile (should have toggle functionality)
3. Verify all pages load correctly
