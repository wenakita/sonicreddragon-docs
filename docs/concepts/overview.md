# Overview

Sonic Red Dragon is a cross-chain ERC-20 compatible token built on LayerZero V2, featuring advanced security measures and verifiable randomness through dRAND integration.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Seamlessly transfer tokens across multiple blockchains using LayerZero V2
- **Enhanced Security**: Advanced security features including role-based access control and pausable transfers
- **Verifiable Randomness**: Integration with dRAND for secure and verifiable random number generation
- **Governance**: Decentralized governance system with ve69LP tokenomics
- **Jackpot System**: Innovative jackpot distribution mechanism with cross-chain capabilities

## Architecture

Sonic Red Dragon's architecture is built on three main pillars:

1. **Core Token System**
   - ERC-20 compatible token with cross-chain capabilities
   - Advanced security features and role management
   - Fee mechanics and distribution system

2. **Cross-Chain Infrastructure**
   - LayerZero V2 integration for secure cross-chain messaging
   - Chain-specific endpoint management
   - Bridge contract for token transfers

3. **Randomness and Security**
   - dRAND integration for verifiable randomness
   - Chainlink VRF support for additional randomness sources
   - Comprehensive security measures and audits
