# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the OmniDragon ecosystem. Understanding these terms will help you navigate the protocol more effectively.

## A

### AMM (Automated Market Maker)
A decentralized exchange protocol that uses a mathematical formula to price assets. OmniDragon tokens can be traded on AMMs like Uniswap, SushiSwap, and PancakeSwap.

### Arbitrum
A Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that offers lower fees and faster transactions. OmniDragon is deployed on Arbitrum to provide a more cost-effective experience.

### Avalanche
A blockchain platform that focuses on high throughput and fast finality. OmniDragon is deployed on Avalanche to reach a wider audience.

## B

### BLS Signature
A cryptographic signature scheme used by the Drand network to verify randomness. OmniDragon uses BLS signatures as part of its randomness verification process.

### BNB Chain
A blockchain platform developed by Binance. OmniDragon is deployed on BNB Chain to provide a low-fee alternative to Ethereum.

### Bridge
A protocol that enables the transfer of assets between different blockchains. OmniDragon uses a cross-chain bridge to enable seamless operation across multiple blockchains.

### Burn
The process of permanently removing tokens from circulation. OmniDragon implements automatic burns to create deflationary pressure on the token supply.

## C

### Chainlink VRF
A verifiable random function service provided by Chainlink. OmniDragon uses Chainlink VRF as one of its randomness sources for the jackpot system.

### Circuit Breaker
A security mechanism that can pause contract functionality in case of emergency. OmniDragon implements circuit breakers to protect user funds in case of unexpected issues.

### Cross-Chain
Referring to operations that span multiple blockchains. OmniDragon is a cross-chain protocol that operates seamlessly across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, and Avalanche.

## D

### Deflationary
A token with a decreasing supply over time. OmniDragon is deflationary due to its automatic burn mechanism.

### Drand Network
A distributed randomness beacon that provides publicly verifiable random values. OmniDragon uses the Drand Network as one of its randomness sources.

### DRAGON
The native token of the OmniDragon protocol. DRAGON is used for transactions, governance, and jackpot participation.

## E

### EIP-1559
An Ethereum Improvement Proposal that changed the transaction fee mechanism. OmniDragon supports EIP-1559 transactions on Ethereum and compatible chains.

### Ethereum
A decentralized blockchain platform that supports smart contracts. Ethereum is the primary chain for OmniDragon's governance and liquidity.

## F

### Fee
A percentage of each transaction that is collected by the protocol. OmniDragon implements a fee system that distributes value to various stakeholders.

### Fee Distribution
The process of allocating collected fees to different components of the protocol. OmniDragon distributes fees to the jackpot vault, governance rewards, and token burning.

## G

### Gas
The computational cost of executing operations on a blockchain. Gas fees are paid in the native currency of the blockchain (e.g., ETH on Ethereum).

### Governance
The process by which protocol parameters and upgrades are decided. OmniDragon implements a governance system that allows token holders to vote on proposals.

## J

### Jackpot
A jackpot that is distributed to winners based on certain conditions. OmniDragon's jackpot system automatically enters users into a jackpot when they buy tokens.

### Jackpot Vault
A contract that holds the funds for the jackpot. The OmniDragon jackpot vault receives 6.9% of all buy/sell fees.

## L

### LayerZero
A cross-chain messaging protocol that enables communication between different blockchains. OmniDragon uses LayerZero for its cross-chain functionality.

### Liquidity Pool
A collection of funds locked in a smart contract that facilitates trading. OmniDragon tokens are paired with other tokens (e.g., ETH, BNB) in liquidity pools.

### Lottery Entry
A chance to win the jackpot. OmniDragon automatically creates jackpot entries when users buy tokens.

## M

### Multi-Signature
A security feature that requires multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. OmniDragon uses multi-signature controls for critical operations.

## O

### Oracle
A service that provides external data to a blockchain. OmniDragon uses oracles for randomness and price data.

## P

### Proposal
A suggested change to the protocol that is voted on by governance participants. OmniDragon governance allows token holders to create and vote on proposals.

## Q

### Quorum
The minimum number of votes required for a governance proposal to pass. OmniDragon governance requires a quorum to ensure that decisions have sufficient support.

## R

### Randomness
Unpredictable values used for various purposes, including winner selection in the jackpot system. OmniDragon uses multiple sources of randomness to ensure security.

### Reentrancy Guard
A security mechanism that prevents a contract from being called recursively. OmniDragon implements reentrancy guards to protect against reentrancy attacks.

## S

### Slippage
The difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. OmniDragon's swap interface allows users to set a slippage tolerance.

### Smart Contract
A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. OmniDragon is built on smart contracts that automate various functions.

### Staking
The process of locking tokens to receive rewards. OmniDragon governance allows users to stake LP tokens to receive voting power and rewards.

### Swap
The process of exchanging one token for another. Users can swap other tokens for DRAGON through the OmniDragon app or decentralized exchanges.

## T

### Time-Lock
A security feature that enforces a delay between when an action is initiated and when it can be executed. OmniDragon uses time-locks for sensitive operations.

### Token
A digital asset on a blockchain. DRAGON is the native token of the OmniDragon protocol.

### Tokenomics
The economic model of a token, including supply, distribution, and incentives. OmniDragon's tokenomics are designed to create sustainable value for all participants.

### Transaction
An operation that changes the state of a blockchain. OmniDragon transactions include token transfers, swaps, and cross-chain operations.

## V

### ve69LP
Vote-escrowed LP tokens used for governance in the OmniDragon protocol. Users stake LP tokens to receive ve69LP, which grants voting power and rewards.

### Verifiable Random Function (VRF)
A cryptographic function that provides verifiable randomness. OmniDragon uses Chainlink VRF as part of its randomness infrastructure.

### Voting Power
The influence a user has in governance decisions. In OmniDragon, voting power is determined by the amount of LP tokens staked and the lock duration.

## W

### Wallet
A software application or hardware device that stores private keys and allows users to interact with blockchains. Users connect their wallets to the OmniDragon app to perform transactions.

### Winner Selection
The process of determining who wins the jackpot. OmniDragon uses secure randomness to select winners in a fair and transparent manner.

## Technical Terms

### ABI (Application Binary Interface)
A standard way to interact with smart contracts. Developers use ABIs to interact with OmniDragon contracts through the SDK.

### BEP-20
A token standard on BNB Chain, similar to ERC-20. The DRAGON token on BNB Chain is a BEP-20 token.

### ERC-20
A token standard on Ethereum. The DRAGON token on Ethereum is an ERC-20 token.

### Solidity
The programming language used to write smart contracts on Ethereum and compatible chains. OmniDragon contracts are written in Solidity.

### Web3
A term referring to the decentralized web built on blockchain technology. OmniDragon is part of the Web3 ecosystem.

## Protocol-Specific Terms

### DRAGON Token
The native token of the OmniDragon protocol. It implements a 10% buy/sell fee and a 0.69% transfer fee.

### Jackpot System
OmniDragon's automatic jackpot system that creates entries when users buy tokens. Winners are selected based on secure randomness.

### OmniDragon SDK
A software development kit that allows developers to integrate with the OmniDragon protocol. It provides functions for token operations, cross-chain transfers, jackpot interactions, and governance.

### Randomness Infrastructure
OmniDragon's system for generating secure, verifiable random numbers. It combines multiple sources of randomness for maximum security.

### ve69LP Governance
OmniDragon's governance system that allows users to stake LP tokens to receive voting power. Longer lock periods grant higher voting power.
