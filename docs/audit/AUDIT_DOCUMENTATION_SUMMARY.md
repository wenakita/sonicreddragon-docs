# OmniDragon VRF System - Audit Documentation Package

## Overview

This package contains comprehensive technical documentation for the OmniDragon VRF System security audit. The system provides secure, verifiable randomness across Sonic and Arbitrum blockchains using Chainlink VRF 2.5 and Drand beacon networks.

## Documentation Contents

### 1. Technical Specification
**File**: `docs/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md`

Comprehensive technical overview including:
- System architecture and design
- Contract specifications
- Randomness sources (Chainlink VRF, Drand)
- Optimization mechanisms (Bucket, Pool systems)
- Security model and gas optimization
- External dependencies and known limitations

### 2. Threat Model
**File**: `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`

Detailed security analysis covering:
- Assets at risk
- Threat actors
- Attack vectors and mitigations
- Risk matrix
- Security assumptions
- Incident response plan

### 3. Architecture Diagrams
**File**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md`

Visual representations using Mermaid diagrams:
- High-level system architecture
- Request flow sequences
- Contract interactions
- Security architecture
- Cost structure
- Performance metrics

### 4. Smart Contracts
**Directory**: `contracts/`

Core contracts to audit:
1. `core/OmniDragonRandomnessProvider.sol` - Main coordinator
2. `vrf/drand/DrandVRFIntegrator.sol` - Drand integration
3. `vrf/chainlink/ChainlinkVRFIntegrator.sol` - Chainlink bridge
4. `vrf/chainlink/OmniDragonVRFRequester.sol` - Arbitrum VRF requester

### 5. Test Suite
**Directory**: `test/`

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for cross-chain flows
- Gas profiling results

## Key Security Considerations

### Critical Focus Areas
1. **Cross-chain Message Authentication**: LayerZero integration security
2. **Randomness Integrity**: No predictability or manipulation
3. **Reentrancy Protection**: All payment functions secured
4. **Access Control**: Proper authorization checks

### Known Risks
1. **Centralized Control**: Owner privileges need multi-sig
2. **External Dependencies**: LayerZero, Chainlink, Drand
3. **Cross-chain Latency**: 1-2 minute delays for Chainlink
