# Introduction to OmniDragon

Welcome to the OmniDragon documentation! OmniDragon is a cross-chain token system built with an emphasis on secure randomness and scalability across multiple blockchains.

## What is OmniDragon?

OmniDragon is a next-generation token system that combines:

- **Cross-chain functionality**: Transfer tokens seamlessly between supported blockchains
- **Multi-source randomness**: Industry-leading randomness generation from multiple sources
- **Security by design**: Robust architecture that protects against manipulation
- **Scalable infrastructure**: Built to support growing ecosystems and high transaction volumes

## Core System Components

The OmniDragon system consists of several integrated components:

1. **OmniDragon Token**: The core ERC-20 compatible token contract
2. **OmniDragonVRFConsumer**: Aggregates randomness from multiple sources
3. **OmniDragonPeriphery**: Handles cross-chain messaging and token transfers
4. **Dragon Ecosystem**: Additional utilities, distribution mechanisms, and governance

## Randomness Infrastructure

One of OmniDragon's most innovative features is its multi-source randomness system. Unlike traditional blockchain randomness solutions that depend on a single source, OmniDragon aggregates randomness from:

- **drand League of Entropy**: A distributed randomness beacon with 30-second periods
- **drand Quicknet**: A faster randomness network with 3-second periods
- **drand EVMnet**: An Ethereum-optimized randomness network
- **Chainlink VRF**: Verifiable Random Function from the Chainlink oracle network

This multi-source approach dramatically increases security by eliminating single points of failure.
