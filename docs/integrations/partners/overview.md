```

## Technical Integration Options

### Smart Contract Integration

Partners can directly integrate with OmniDragon's smart contracts:

```solidity
// Example: Partner contract integrating with OmniDragon
contract PartnerIntegration {
    IOmniDragon public omniDragon;
    IDragonJackpotVault public jackpotVault;
    IOmniDragonVRFConsumer public vrfConsumer;
    
    constructor(
        address _omniDragon,
        address _jackpotVault,
        address _vrfConsumer
    ) {
        omniDragon = IOmniDragon(_omniDragon);
        jackpotVault = IDragonJackpotVault(_jackpotVault);
        vrfConsumer = IOmniDragonVRFConsumer(_vrfConsumer);
    }
    
    // Example: Create a partner pool with OmniDragon tokens
    function createPartnerPool(uint256 amount) external {
        // Transfer OmniDragon tokens from sender
        omniDragon.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        
        // Create the partner pool
        // ...
    }
    
    // Example: Use OmniDragon's randomness for partner mechanics
    function partnerRandomnessRequest() external {
        // Request randomness
        vrfConsumer.requestRandomness(address(this));
    }
}
```

### DragonPartnerRegistry Integration

For deeper integrations, partners can utilize the DragonPartnerRegistry:

```solidity
// Example: Register as a partner
function registerAsPartner() external {
    // Get the partner registry
    IDragonPartnerRegistry registry = IDragonPartnerRegistry(registryAddress);
    
    // Partner details
    string memory name = "Partner Project";
    string memory website = "https://partner-project.com";
    string memory description = "Partner project description";
    
    // Register as partner
    registry.registerPartner(name, website, description);
}
```

### API Integration

For non-blockchain applications, OmniDragon offers RESTful API endpoints:

```javascript
// Example: Fetch OmniDragon token data
async function getOmniDragonData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.sonicreddragon.io/v1/token/data', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  });
  
  return await response.json();
}
```
