## 🔧 **Implementation Constants**

### 📝 **Smart Contract Updates Needed**

```solidity
// Update OmniDragonLotteryManager.sol constants:
uint256 public constant BASE_WIN_PROB_BPS = 10;      // 0.1% for $10
uint256 public constant MAX_BASE_WIN_PROB_BPS = 400;   // 4% for $10k
uint256 public constant MAX_BOOSTED_WIN_PROB_BPS = 1000; // 10% max with voting power
```

### 🎯 **Probability Calculation**
```solidity
// Linear scaling from 0.1% to 4%
if (swapAmountUSD <= MIN_AMOUNT_USD) {
    probability = 10; // 0.1%
} else if (swapAmountUSD >= MAX_AMOUNT_USD) {
    probability = 400; // 4%
} else {
    // Linear interpolation between 10 and 400 basis points
    uint256 additionalProb = (swapAmountUSD - MIN_AMOUNT_USD) * 390 / (MAX_AMOUNT_USD - MIN_AMOUNT_USD);
    probability = 10 + additionalProb;
}
```
